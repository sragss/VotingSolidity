# Solidity Voting Contract
Written to demo how easy writing trustworthy and reliable code is on the ethereum blockchain.


# Truffle Setup
[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript) allows the testing. Truffle requires a local ETH node. During this dev I used [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache). All it requires to setup is download, launch app. Network configs have to be defined in `truffle-config.js` under `networks/development`.
